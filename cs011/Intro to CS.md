# Intro to CS

## Functions

- Sequence of statements that has a name

- Can think of it as a sub-program

- Functions:

  - Have a name
  - Take parameters

  Syntax:

```python
# Standard variable naming applies
def fname(arg0, arg1, ..., argN):
    block
    
def fname():
    block
```

### Digging deeper

- When a function is called, the calling program is suspended
- The values of the local parameters are assigned to the function parameters
- The body of the function is executed
