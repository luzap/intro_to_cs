# Advanced topic in OOP

## Privacy

- private object members are only visible from within the class (with self)
- not even visible by subclasses.
- in Python, adding double underscore to the front of the method of the variable
- One way to save work is to specialize things that have already been built


## Super and subclasses

- A sub-class is a specialization of a super-class
